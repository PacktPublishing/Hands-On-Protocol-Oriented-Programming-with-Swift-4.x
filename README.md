# Hands-On Protocol Oriented Programming with Swift 4.x [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Protocol Oriented Programming with Swift 4.x [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-protocol-oriented-programming-swift-4x-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789610307), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Swift has become the number one language used in iOS and MacOS development. 

The Swift standard library is developed using protocol-oriented programming techniques, generics, and first-class value semantics; therefore, every Swift developer should understand these powerful concepts and how to take advantage of them in their application design. This course will help you understand the differences between object-oriented programming and protocol-oriented programming. It will demonstrate how to work with protocol-oriented programming via real-world use cases. 
You will gain a solid knowledge of the various types that can be used in Swift and the differences between value and reference types. You will learn how protocol-oriented programming techniques can be used to develop very flexible and easy-to-maintain code. By the end of the course, you'll be confident and have a good understanding of protocol-oriented programming and how to utilize it to build powerful and practical applications.
