## About the Video Course
You might be working in an organization, or have your own business, where data is being generated continuously (structured or unstructured) and you are looking to develop your skillset so you can jump into the field of Data Science. This hands-on guide shows non-programmers like you how to process information that's initially too messy or difficult to access.	
In this course, you will gather data, prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analyses, create meaningful data visualizations, and more! This course will equip you with the tools and technologies you need to analyze datasets (real-life datasets containing lots of anomalies) using Python so that you can confidently jump into the field and enhance your skillset. The best part of this course is the take-away code templates generated using the real-life dataset. 
Towards the end of the course, you'll build an intuitive understanding of all the aspects available in Python for Data Wrangling.
